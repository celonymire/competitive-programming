# Doxyfile 1.15.0
# Configuration file for Doxygen for the competitive-programming project.
#
# This configuration enables the Doxygen Awesome theme (as a submodule)
# and configures Doxygen to copy and include the theme CSS and JS.
#
# Notes:
# - The repository should contain the theme at: doxygen-awesome-css/
#   (for example added as a git submodule).
# - A small footer file is expected at: docs/doxygen/footer-doxygen-awesome.html
#   which references the copied JS (doxygen-awesome.js) that Doxygen copies into
#   the docs output directory via HTML_EXTRA_FILES.
#
# To regenerate docs:
#   cd competitive-programming
#   doxygen Doxyfile
